# Awesome Multi-Agent Orchestrators [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> An awesome-style, selectively curated list of open-source and publicly documented multi-agent orchestrators, coding-agent workspaces, agent runtimes, company operating systems, and adjacent governance layers.

[Website](https://openorchestrators.org/) • [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

The public website is [Open Orchestrators](https://openorchestrators.org/). This repo is intentionally narrow: it is not a general AI tools list. Projects belong here when multi-agent coordination, parallel agent execution, agent workflows, or agent-centered operating systems are the product, not a side feature. Governance and enforcement layers are tracked separately when they control agent actions, permissions, approvals, budgets, trust, settlement, or audit trails without acting as the orchestrator itself.

## News

Open Orchestrators is also a lightweight news site for meaningful updates from projects already in the directory.

- Add news posts as Markdown files in [`src/content/news`](./src/content/news).
- Set `playerSlug` to the matching entry in [`src/data/orchestrators.ts`](./src/data/orchestrators.ts).
- Include `sourceName` and `sourceUrl` when the post is based on an official announcement, docs page, or repository update.
- The homepage renders the latest story alongside the directory; `/news/` is the full archive.

## Not Open But Important

Closed products that are not part of the open directory, but matter to the community because they influence how builders think about multi-agent orchestration.

- [Crewlet](https://www.crewlet.io/) ([X](https://x.com/crewlet_)) - Not open-source; included because it frames a self-improving multi-agent company OS for growth, engineering, support, and data operations across existing tools.
- [Augment Code Intent](https://www.augmentcode.com/product/intent) - Not open-source; included because Intent puts coordinated agents, isolated workspaces, and living specs in one developer workspace.

## CLI Agent Session Workspaces

Tools that manage parallel CLI-agent sessions, terminals, issue boards, worktrees, diffs, and local review loops. These are useful for agentic coding work, but they are tracked separately from orchestrator/player entries when they do not manage agent teams or runtime behavior directly.

- [Lanes](https://lanes.sh/) - macOS workspace where Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other agentic CLIs run as parallel real-PTY sessions with boards, auto-created git worktrees, session resume, diffs, and file editing.

## Governance And Enforcement

Policy, permission, approval, budget, trust, reputation, settlement, and audit layers that sit between agent intent and execution. These are not orchestrators themselves; they govern actions routed through an orchestrator, framework, coding agent, MCP server, marketplace, exchange, or application runtime.

### Open and open-core governance tools

- [Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) - MIT-licensed runtime governance toolkit for AI agents with deterministic policy enforcement, zero-trust identity, execution sandboxing, SRE controls, and compliance checks.

- [Veto](https://veto.so/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/PlawIO/veto)) - Apache-2.0 authorization layer for AI agent tool calls, with TypeScript and Python SDKs, YAML policies, approval routing, and audit logs. Veto Cloud is commercial.
- [SettleBridge](https://settlebridge.ai/) ([GitHub org](https://github.com/a2a-settlement)) - Trust and policy gateway for agent-to-agent settlement, including reputation thresholds, spending limits, provenance requirements, escrow, dispute resolution, marketplace bounties, and cryptographic audit trails. The related A2A Settlement repo is MIT-licensed; SettleBridge's public license metadata is not fully consistent yet.

### Commercial and platform governance layers

- [Databricks Unity AI Gateway](https://www.databricks.com/blog/ai-gateway-governance-layer-agentic-ai) - Commercial Databricks platform layer for governing LLM access, MCP servers, APIs, observability, costs, guardrails, fallbacks, and rate limits in agentic AI workflows.

## Agent-Friendly Tooling

Tools that are not orchestrators themselves, but make multi-agent systems easier to operate, measure, observe, or reuse.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full review criteria.

## Local Development

This repo contains the Awesome Multi-Agent Orchestrators list and a small Astro site for [`openorchestrators.org`](https://openorchestrators.org/).

```bash
cd open-orchestrators.org
npm install
npm run dev
```

Most editorial updates should happen in [`src/data/orchestrators.ts`](./src/data/orchestrators.ts), which is the source of truth for directory entries, rank order, notes, tags, and links.

News updates should happen in [`src/content/news`](./src/content/news). Directory entries and news posts are intentionally separate: directory metadata describes the player; news Markdown describes a dated update about that player.
