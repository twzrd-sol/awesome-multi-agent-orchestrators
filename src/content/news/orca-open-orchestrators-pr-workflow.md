Orca says builders can now create and merge GitHub pull requests inside Orca, either manually or by AI. The announcement also shows a GitHub PR list and pull-request details view inside Orca, positioning PR review and merge work as part of the local agent IDE instead of a handoff back to GitHub.

The source post is a reply to a user asking whether Orca could handle the steps that normally force them to leave the tool and go to GitHub. Orca's answer: the PR flow is already available, with in-app controls for creating a PR from committed branch changes and views for managing pull requests.

For Open Orchestrators readers, the important signal is not just convenience. Coding-agent products are turning into operator workspaces around the whole development loop: worktree, files, terminal, agent run, PR creation, PR detail review, and merge. That matters because an orchestrator becomes more useful when it can keep state and decisions close to where the agent is already working.

This also fits Orca's recent direction. Earlier Orca updates focused on local IDE workflows, computer use, PR review, and cross-platform agent control. Bringing PR creation and merging into the same surface tightens the path from agent-generated changes to reviewed, mergeable work.

Source confidence: High for the PR creation, merge, PR list, and PR details claims because they come from Orca's official X account. Medium for ecosystem implications because the post announces UI/product capability, not independent adoption data or reliability benchmarks.

Evidence:

- [Orca official X post on in-app PR creation and merging](https://x.com/orca_build/status/2057169908103069857)
- [Orca GitHub repository](https://github.com/stablyai/orca)

Explicit non-claims:

- This update does not claim every GitHub PR operation is supported inside Orca.
- This update does not benchmark the AI-driven PR creation or merge flow.
- This update does not claim Orca replaces GitHub review policies, CI checks, or repository permissions.
