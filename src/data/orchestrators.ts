For Agent Analytics today, use the existing global agent skill path: if the SIDJUA workflow runs a coding agent that already has the Agent Analytics skill from skills.sh, that agent can wire event reporting, verify events are arriving, connect to Agent Analytics, and read the results without a SIDJUA-specific integration.",

First verify the site is reporting page views, CTA clicks, signup starts, and completed signup events to Agent Analytics. Then fetch the last 7 days of Agent Analytics data and compare it with the prior 7 days. Tell me what happened to customer traffic and the signup path: visits, sources, CTA clicks, signup starts, completed signups, conversion rate, and the biggest drop-off. Recommend whether we should keep the CTA, revert it, or assign the next SIDJUA-governed experiment.",
